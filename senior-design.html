			<p>The senior design class gives students the opportunity to gain real world experience by allowing students to work with projects given by real companies in teams.  It simulates a workplace in the sense that we have a customer, subject matter expert, and an advisor.  This is a two-semester course where the first semester is dedicated to designing and the second to implementing.  Topics of some of the lectures include patent, RFP, and the process of getting a customer.</p>
			<p>The project that was assigned to our team of four is a GE Global project.  GE wanted us to create library modules that can be pieced together; the three modules to be created are PID, PWM, and bang-bang controller.  The module I was responsible for was the bang-bang controller.</p>
