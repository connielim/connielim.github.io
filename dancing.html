			<p>I wanted to become a Kpop star when I was in high school.  It seemed so fun seeing the stars dancing and singing.  Even though I couldn’t fulfill the dream, I can pretend to be one by dancing.  Dancing also helps me relieve stress and show off my moves to my family and friends.</p>
			<p>Even though dancing is a hobby, it has also honed my observation and perfection skill.  Dancing has taught me to perfect the position of every body part of each move such as the angle, how far out the arm should be, how much energy should be put into it, and so much more.  A successful dance cover to me is when you place your dance cover and the original dance side by side and notice little to no difference between the two.  </p>
			<p>Here are some videos of me dancing!  I don’t only cover kpop dances; I’ve also participated in the Korean fan dance.  Check them out!  </p>

			<p>Sometimes when I need motivation or I need real people to be my role model, I look at other people’s covers.  There are so awesome and I strive to be like them.  Check them out too!</p>
